ChatGPT(chatgpt-4o-latest/General)> in linux using the swaywm how can I truncate my home folder to tilda through the "sway/window" module?
<shell-maker-end-of-prompt>
In SwayWM, the "sway/window" module corresponds to how window titles and other elements are shown in the status bar, typically through the usage of **swaybar** (the default status bar for Sway). If you’re looking to truncate your home folder path to a tilde (`~`) when displayed in the window title in the bar, you'll configure the format for how the window’s title is displayed.

You can achieve this by setting the `format` in your **sway/window** module to replace `/home/username` with `~`. This can be done by using a regular expression (regex) with the `format` or `pango_markup` fields (depending on how the module and bar plugin is configured).

Here’s how you can approach it:

1. **Edit the sway configuration file**
   The Sway configuration is typically located in the path `~/.config/sway/config`. Launch a text editor and open that file:

   ```bash
   nano ~/.config/sway/config
   ```

2. **Override the Window Title Format**
   In your configuration file, you will need to modify the swaybar configuration or the module that handles window titles if you’re using `swaybar` or a similar tool. Most sway setups use a tool like `waybar` or `swaybar` that can interact with the `sway/window` module.

   If you're using something like `waybar`, you would configure the `sway/window` module in `~/.config/waybar/config` and use a custom formatted command to achieve the truncation.

   For example, if using **waybar**, you may have something like this in your `config` file:

   ```json
   "modules": {
     "sway/window": {
       "format": "{title}",
       "tooltip": false
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Using a Script**
   To handle truncating `/home/username` to `~`, you can use a custom shell script that will substitute the home directory path with `~` and display that in your waybar window title configuration.

   First, create a script (say, `window_title.sh`):

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   title=$(swaymsg -t get_tree | jq -r '.. | try select(.focused == true) | .name')
   echo "${title//$HOME/~}"
   ```

   This script uses `swaymsg`, fetches the current focused window’s title, and replaces instances of `$HOME` with `~`.

   Save the script as `~/scripts/window_title.sh`, make it executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/scripts/window_title.sh
   ```

4. **Configure the Waybar Module**
   Now, modify the `sway/window` module to use this script in your Waybar configuration. Replace the `format` command with the following in `~/.config/waybar/config`:

   ```json
   "modules": {
     "sway/window": {
       "format": "bash ~/scripts/window_title.sh",
       "tooltip": false
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Restart Sway**
   After making these changes, restart Sway for the new configuration to take effect:

   ```bash
   swaymsg reload
   ```

Now, the window titles that include your home directory (`/home/username/...`) will be automatically truncated to `~/...` in the status bar.

---

### Notes:
- **Swaybar** or **Waybar** specifics can vary. Ensure your status bar (or module) supports custom scripts or substitutes.
- The `jq` tool is used to parse the JSON from `swaymsg`. Ensure `jq` is installed (`sudo apt install jq` if not).


ChatGPT(chatgpt-4o-latest/General)> in emacs how do I print the frame title replacing the full home folder with ~?
<shell-maker-end-of-prompt>
In Emacs, you can customize the frame title (the text shown in the window's title bar) to display the path of the currently open file or buffer while replacing the full home directory path (`/home/username`) with a tilde (`~`). Here's how you can do this:

### Step-by-step Configuration:

1. **Set up the custom frame title format**:
   To manipulate how the frame title is displayed, you need to modify the Emacs variable `frame-title-format`. This variable allows you to define a format string (or a list) to customize the frame title.

   We will use a function that transforms the full path by substituting the home directory with `~`.

2. **Add the following code to your Emacs configuration**:
   Open your configuration file (`~/.emacs` or `~/.emacs.d/init.el`) and add the following Lisp code:

   ```elisp
   ;; Replace home directory with `~` in the frame title
   (defun my-frame-title-format ()
     "Return the buffer's file path with home replaced by `~`."
     (let ((filename (or (buffer-file-name) (dired-directory default-directory))))
       (if filename
           (abbreviate-file-name filename)  ; Use ~ for home directory
         "%b")))  ; If no file, show the buffer name (%b)

   ;; Set the frame title format
   (setq frame-title-format '(:eval (my-frame-title-format)))
   ```

   ### Explanation:
   - **`(buffer-file-name)`**: Returns the full file name of the buffer.
   - **`(dired-directory default-directory)`**: Handles buffers that are opened in Dired mode (directory browsing).
   - **`(abbreviate-file-name filename)`**: This is the key function that converts `/home/username/...` to `~/...`.
   - **`(:eval ...)`**: Dynamically evaluates the result of the `my-frame-title-format` function. We set up the dynamic title using this for the `frame-title-format` variable.

3. **Reload the Emacs configuration**:
   After adding the code, either restart Emacs or evaluate the changes using the following command:

   ```elisp
   M-x eval-buffer
   ```

   Alternatively, you can place the cursor at the end of the new code and type `C-x C-e` to evaluate it.

4. **Test the changes**:
   - If you open a file inside your home directory (e.g., `~/Documents/myfile.txt`), the Emacs frame title should now display `~/Documents/myfile.txt` instead of `/home/username/Documents/myfile.txt`.
   - Open a buffer that is not associated with a file (such as `*scratch*` or `*Messages*`) and observe that the frame title falls back to the buffer name (`%b` stands for buffer name).

### Additional customizations:
- If you prefer to show other information, such as the full buffer name or whether the buffer has been modified, you can adjust the format string in `my-frame-title-format` as needed. For example:

   ```elisp
   ;; Show the buffer name along with the full modified filename
   (setq frame-title-format '(:eval
                              (format "%s - Emacs"
                                      (my-frame-title-format))))
   ```

This simple customization will print the window's file path in a more user-friendly way, replacing the lengthy home folder with a `~`.
