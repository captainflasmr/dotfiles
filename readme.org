Welcome to my collection of Linux dotfiles! This repository contains configuration files for various applications, window managers, and utilities I use on my Linux system. These dotfiles are tailored for a highly customized setup with tools like Sway (Wayland compositor), Waybar, and other modern Linux utilities.

The goal of this repository is to version control my configurations, make them easily reproducible across systems, and share them with others who might find them useful or inspiring.

* Overview

This repository includes dotfiles for:

- *Window Manager*: Sway (Wayland) with custom scripts and configurations.
- *Status Bars*: Waybar (multiple custom configurations).
- *Launchers*: Rofi and Wofi.
- *File Managers*: Thunar and PCManFM.
- *Media and Graphics*: MPV, DigiKam, GThumb, and Krita.
- *Development*: Visual Studio Code (User settings and keybindings).
- *Keyboard Customization*: KMonad, XRemap, and custom keymaps.
- *Other Utilities*: Dunst (notifications), Fusuma (touchpad gestures), KeepassXC, and more.

These configurations are primarily designed for a modern Linux environment running on Wayland with a focus on productivity and aesthetics.
